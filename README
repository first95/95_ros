# Grasshoppers ROS Code

This repo will house all ROS code we use on the team. The goal for this year is to setup a LiDAR system with ROS.

Furthermore, I would like to have this repo house a modular system approach to ROS to make it easier to get into using ROS for your robot. Many teams already have systems in place and switching 100% over to ROS may seem like a lot of work and silly. There is several things you need to know before getting into ROS. My goal is to create small modules that are easily integratable into teams existing code bases.

We will see where this project takes us!
